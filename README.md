# PROFFIT

This is the PROFFIT C++ package (Eckert et al. 2011). No longer actively maintained by the developer. 

PROFFIT is a stand-alone package designed for the analysis of X-ray surface brightness profiles. It has been used in over 50 scientific publications thus far ([see here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...526A..79E/citations)). All of the features of PROFFIT (and more) have now been ported to the Python package [``pyproffit``](https://github.com/domeckert/pyproffit).

An extensive user guide can be found here:
